            <p>Hello, my name is Elizabeth Richardson! I am a graduate of The University of Arizona with a degree in Marketing, Class of 2014. I am currently taking the University of Arizona's Continuing Education Coding Bootcamp to become a Web Developer. </p>
            <p>I worked for over three years as an Account Executive in the logistics industry managing client shipping needs. I enjoyed working in this industry but I am ready for my next challenge.</p>
            <p> I am very excited to learn different programming languages, database management, and the basics for building apps. In my free time I like to read, cook, and travel the world!</p>
